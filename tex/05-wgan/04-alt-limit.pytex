\points{5d} Let's tweak the alternate objective so that an optimal discriminator exists. Consider the same objective $L_D$ 
and the same limit $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. Now, suppose that $D_{\phi}$ is restricted to differentiable functions 
whose derivative with respect to $x$ is always between -1 and 1. It can still output any real number. Is there now a discriminator $D_{\phi}$ 
out of this class of functions that minimizes $L_D$? Briefly describe what the optimal $D_{\phi}$ looks like as 
a function of $x$.
