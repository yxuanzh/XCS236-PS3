\textbf{Instructor Note}

PS3 is a fair mixture of written and coding questions. Fortunately, training these models
will take substantially less time than PS2. However, it is also in your best interest to make sure that your code 
is properly vectorized so that the models run faster. If you plan on training the models on GPU, make sure your 
code can also run on CPU since this we will be running the autograder on CPU.

Here are the expected train times for each part of the assignment:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ~5 minutes for \texttt{MAF} flow model
    \item ~5 minutes for \texttt{GAN} with nonsaturating loss
    \item ~10 minutes for \texttt{CGAN} with nonsaturating loss
    \item ~5 minutes for \texttt{GAN} with wasserstein gp loss
\end{enumerate}

The following is a checklist of various functions you need to implement in the
submission, in chronological order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{forward} in \texttt{src/submission/flow\_network.py}
    \item \texttt{inverse} in \texttt{src/submission/flow\_network.py}
    \item \texttt{log\_probs} in \texttt{src/submission/flow\_network.py}
    \item \texttt{loss\_nonsaturating\_g} in \texttt{src/submission/gan.py}
    \item \texttt{loss\_nonsaturating\_d} in \texttt{src/submission/gan.py}
    \item \texttt{conditional\_loss\_nonsaturating\_g} in \texttt{src/submission/gan.py}
    \item \texttt{conditional\_loss\_nonsaturating\_d} in \texttt{src/submission/gan.py}
    \item \texttt{loss\_wasserstein\_gp\_g} in \texttt{src/submission/gan.py}
    \item \texttt{loss\_wasserstein\_gp\_d} in \texttt{src/submission/gan.py}
\end{enumerate}

You will submit the entire \texttt{submission} directory. To do so run the command  below from the \texttt{src} directory
\begin{verbatim}
    zip -r submission.zip submission
\end{verbatim}

or you can choose to zip the folder up manually.

Your submission zip should contain:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{src/submission/\_\_init\_\_.py}
    \item \texttt{src/submission/flow\_network.py}
    \item \texttt{src/submission/gan.py}
\end{enumerate}
